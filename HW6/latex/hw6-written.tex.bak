% ----- PROBLEM 1 ----- %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}{1}
Given three points $a,b,c \in \RR^2$ that are not collinear (not all on one line) and that are sorted in anticlockwise order, we define
%
\begin{align*}
T &= \Delta (a,b,c) \\
P &= P_2(T) \\
L &= \left\{ \vphantom{\pd{p}{n}\left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right)} \right.
p \mapsto p(a),
p \mapsto p(b),
p \mapsto p(c), \\
&\qquad\quad
p \mapsto \pd{p}{n}\left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right),
p \mapsto \pd{p}{n}\left(\frac{b+c}{2}\right),
\left. p \mapsto \pd{p}{n}\left(\frac{c+a}{2}\right) \right\}
\subset P*
\end{align*}

% ----- Problem 1(a) ----- %
\begin{itemize}
	\item[(a)]  Show that prescribed data for
	$$p \mapsto p(a),
	p \mapsto p(b),
	p \mapsto p(c),
	p \mapsto \pd{p}{n}\left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right),
	p \mapsto \pd{p}{n}\left(\frac{b+c}{2}\right),
	p \mapsto \pd{p}{n}\left(\frac{c+a}{2}\right)$$
	uniquely determines any $p \in P$. You don't have to show that such a $p$ always exists.

\end{itemize}

% ----- Problem 1(a): Solution ----- %
\begin{solution}
A general second order polynomial in two-dimensions takes the form
$$p(x) = Ax_1^2 + Bx_1x_2 + Cx_2^2 + Dx_1 + Ex_2 + F,$$
where $x = (x_1,x_2) \in \RR^2$.
Since this polynomial has 6 unknown coefficients, the polynomial should be determined by 6 conditions on it's coefficients, assuming non-degeneracy of the prescribed conditions.

In particular, prescribing the conditions $L$ leads to 6 \textit{linear} equations in 6 unknowns.
Again, if we assume non-degeneracy of these equations (where in this case, we assume that non-collinear $a,b,c$ is sufficient), then this linear system will be uniquely solvable for the coefficients $A,B,C,D,E$, and $F$.



\end{solution}
\pagebreak

% ----- Problem 1(b) ----- %
\begin{itemize}
	\item[(b)] Now let $\Omega^h$ be a domain with a regular triangulation $T^h$ such that
	$$\bar{\Omega}^h = \bigcup_{T\in T^h} T.$$
	Is the space
	\begin{gather*}
	V^h = \left\{ \vphantom{\pd{v^h}{n}}
	v^h \colon \bar{\Omega}^h \rightarrow \RR \:\middle|\:
	v^h\!\mid_T\, \in P_2(T), v^h\,\text{is continuous in all vertices},
	\right. \\ \left.
	\pd{v^h}{n}\,\text{is continuous in all edge midpoints}
	\right\}
	\end{gather*}	 
	$H^1$-conforming, i.e. is $V^h \subset H^1(\Omega^h)$?
	\textit{Hint:} Check if there may be any jumps of $v^h$ across triangle edges.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}{2}
We will now complete our finite-element solver for the linear elasticity problem
\begin{align}\label{LinElast_Strong}
\begin{split}
    -c \Laplacian u + au &= f \quad \text{in } \Omega \\
    u &= g \quad \text{on } \partial \Omega
\end{split}
\end{align}

% ----- Problem 2 ----- %
\begin{itemize}
	\item[(a)] Remove lines 1-10 from \code{discretiseLinearElasticity.m} and uncomment the sections of code that are currently commented out.
	Complete the missing commands, including the subfunction \code{assembleStiffness}. Also inspect the \code{assembleLoad} subfunction.

% ----- Problem 2(a) Solution ----- %
\begin{solution}
The finished function \code{discretiseLinearElasticity.m} and subfunction \code{assembleStiffness} is included in Appendix\ref{discLinElastCode}.
\end{solution}
\pagebreak

	\item[(b)] Write a script \code{hw6.m} which
	\begin{itemize}
		\renewcommand{\labelitemii}{$\bullet$}
	    \item Solves the linear elasticity problem on $\Omega^h$, which you may choose from kiwi.mat, maple.mat, pi.mat, ubc.mat.
	    You may also select your own data for $f(x_1,x_2)$, $g(x_1,x_2)$, $a$ and $c$.
	    \textit{Hint:} You have to set \code{GammaD = @(x1,x2) true(size(x1))}.
	    For debugging, you might want to use \code{video10.mat} and check the sparsity patterns of the various matrices.
	    \item Calculates the $L^2$, $H^1$, and $B$ energy norms of the solution, where $B$ is the bilinear form corresponding to the elliptic operator.
	    \item Creates undistorted plots of the mesh, the force $f$, and the solution $u^h$.

% ----- Problem 2(b) Solution ----- %
\begin{solution}
The script \code{hw6.m} is included in Appendix~\ref{hw6Code}.

\pagebreak

	\end{itemize}
	\item[(c)] What problem do you solve numerically when you set \code{GammaD = @(x1,x2) false(size(x1))}?
	Analyse the code to infer its weak formulation.
