\paragraph*{Question 1 $\vert$ 1 mark}% $\vert$ \faFilePdfO}

This assignment is dedicated to a posteriori error estimates for the problem
\begin{equation}\tag{P}\label{eq:primal}
\begin{aligned}
-\Delta u &= f \qquad \text{in } \Omega\\
u &= 0 \qquad \text{on } \partial\Omega
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\Omega$ is the unit square $\left]0,1\right[^2$.

We want to solve this problem because we are interested in the average of $u$ over the set $R = \left]\frac{1}{2},1\right[ \times \left] 0,\frac{1}{2}\right[$.

Following the dual weighted residual method, what is the dual problem that you have to solve for $z$? Write down its weak formulation, then its strong formulation. Don't forget to specify what space the solution and the test functions belong to for the weak formulation.

\emph{Hint:} Indicator function.

% ------------------------------ %
% ---- Question 1: Solution ---- %
% ------------------------------ %
\begin{solution}
We start by rewriting the strong form \eqref{eq:primal} of the \textsc{Poisson-Dirichlet} problem into the weak form.

Since we will be solving this problem with linear finite elements (as indicated in \texttt{hw8.py}), we will take the test functions to be $v \in V = H_0^1(\Omega)$.
Additionally, since $\Omega$ is a convex polygonal domain (namely, the open unit square), we have that the space of linear finite elements $V^h \subset V$ is conforming.

As in the notes, we assume that the data $f$ is an $L^2$-function and that the exact solution is in $H^2$.
Now, multiplying \eqref{eq:primal} by $v \in V = H_0^1(\Omega)$, integrating by parts, and using that fact that $u,v = 0$ on $\partial \Omega$, the resulting weak form of the \texttt{Poisson-Dirichlet} problem is
\begin{align*}
	\int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla v \dx{x}
    = \int_\Omega f v \dx{x},
    \quad \forall \, v \in V,
\end{align*}
or
\begin{align}\tag{W}\label{eq:primal-weak}
	B(u,v) = \left\langle f, v \right\rangle,
    \quad \forall \, v \in V
\end{align}
where we have defined the bilinear form $B(u,v) \coloneqq \int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla v \dx{x}$.

Now, using the dual weighted residual method, we introduce the corresponding dual problem
\begin{align}\tag{W*}\label{eq:dual-weak}
	B(v,z) = J(v),
    \quad \forall \, v \in V
\end{align}
where $J(u)$ is the linear functional
\begin{align}\label{eq:J-defn}
	J(u) = \frac{1}{|R|}\int_R u \dx{x}
\end{align}
representing the quantity of interest, namely the average of the solution $u$ over the region $R = \left]\frac{1}{2},1\right[ \times \left] 0,\frac{1}{2}\right[$.

Now, the dual solution $z$ and test functions $v$ are both in the space $V = H_0^1(\Omega)$, and if we first note that we can write equation \eqref{eq:J-defn} as
\begin{align}\label{eq:J-indicator}
	J(u) = \int_\Omega \left\{ \frac{1}{|R|} I_R \right\} u \dx{x}
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}\label{eq:indicator}
	I_R(x) = \begin{cases}
1, \quad x \in R \\
0, \quad x \not\in R
\end{cases}
\end{align}
is the indicator function on the set $R$, then due to the symmetry $B(v,z) = B(z,v)$ of the bilinear functional $B$, the corresponding strong form of the dual problem \eqref{eq:dual-weak} is simply
\begin{equation}\tag{P*}\label{eq:dual}
\begin{aligned}
-\Delta z &= g \qquad \text{in } \Omega\\
z &= 0 \qquad \text{on } \partial\Omega
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{align*}
g = \frac{1}{|R|} I_R.
\end{align*}
Note additionally that $|R| = \frac{1}{4}$ for $R = \left]\frac{1}{2},1\right[ \times \left] 0,\frac{1}{2}\right[$.

\end{solution}

\paragraph*{Question 2 $\vert$ 4 marks}% $\vert$  \faFileCodeO \: \faFilePdfO}

If the source term in Problem \eqref{eq:primal} is given as
\begin{equation*}
f(x) = a(a+1)x_1^{a-1}x_2(1-x_2) +  2x_1(1-x_1^a)
\end{equation*}
for $a \geq 1$, then the analytical solution is
\begin{equation*}
\bar{u}(x) = x_1(1-x_1^a)x_2(1-x_2)
\end{equation*}
which has an average of
\begin{equation*}
\frac{3a-2+2^{1-a}}{24a+48}
\end{equation*}
over the set $R$.

For large $a$, this problem is numerically challenging: observe that $f$ becomes very large near the right boundary, while it remains comparatively small elsewhere in the domain. As a result, the solution $\bar{u}$ exhibits a sharp boundary layer near $x_1 = 1$.

The global $L^2$-norm error of the solution is overestimated by approximately a factor of 27 by $\eta_{L^2}$.

Is the error overestimated or underestimated? By what factor, approximately?

\begin{solution}

The error appears to be overestimated by a factor which is on the order of 1 and decreasing with $h$, possibly to a number below 1 but it is hard to tell, and my laptop runs out of memory when further refining the grid.

\end{solution}

\item% \faFilePictureO \:
For the convergence studies above we have refined the entire mesh from $64 \times 64$ to $128 \times 128$ to $256 \times 256$. The second mesh is four times larger, the third mesh even 16 times larger than the coarsest one. This makes uniform mesh refinement very expensive. We can probably compute a solution that is just as accurate as the solution on the $256 \times 256$ mesh, by refining only those triangles on the $64 \times 64$ mesh with a noteworthy contribution to the overall error.

Solve Problem \eqref{eq:primal} on the $64 \times 64$ mesh and plot the numerical solutions $u^h$ and $z^h$, the cell residuals $\lVert r_T \rVert_{L^2}$, the dual weights $\lVert w_T \rVert_{L^2}$ (approximated with either the expensive or the cheap strategy) and the local error indicators $\eta_T$. What triangles of the $64 \times 64$ mesh would you refine to compute the average of $u$ over $R$ more accurately? A rough description like `near the left boundary' will do. Also give a brief reason for your answer:

\begin{solution}

Inspecting the cell residuals and the dual weights (figures \ref{fig:rT} and \ref{fig:wT} in Appendix \ref{SolnFigures}), we see that error in the average of $u$ over $R$ comes primarily from two sources: first, error occurs due to the boundary layer near $x=1$ as seen by $\LTwoNorm{r_T}$; second, $\LTwoNorm{w_T}$ shows that error occurs along the discontinuity of the indicator function, i.e. inside the domain at the boundary between $R$ and the rest of $\Omega$.

When compararing the relative effect of these two sources of error we can use the local error indicators $\eta_T$ which take both $r_T$ and $w_T$ into account.
From the plot of $\eta_T$ (Figure \ref{fig:nT}), we see that the error along the boundary layer dominates, and so the cells near the edge $x=1$ should be refined in order to most effectively lower the error of the function $J(u)$ with the least computational effort.

\end{solution}

\vfill
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph*{(Optional) Bonus Question $\vert$ 1 bonus mark}% $\vert$ \faFilePdfO}

Derive an \textit{a priori} estimate for the error in the above quantity of interest. Does it agree with the numerical results from Q2(b)?

\begin{solution}

From \textsc{Theorem 2.3.22 (Convergence in the $L^2$-Norm)} in the notes, we have that, for linear finite elements, the error $e^h = \bar{u} - u^h$ of the \textsc{Poisson-Dirichlet} problem satisfies
$$ \LTwoNorm{e^h} \leq c h^2 \ANorm{f}{L^2(\Omega)} $$
for some positive constant $c$.

Now, since the quantity of interest $J(u)$ is linear with respect to $u$, we have that $J(\bar{u}) - J(u^h) = J(\bar{u} - u^h) = J(e^h)$, and so
\begin{align*}
\abs{ J(e^h) } &= \abs{ \int_\Omega \left\{ \frac{1}{|R|} I_R \right\} e^h \dx{x} } \\
&\leq \frac{1}{|R|} \LTwoNorm{I_R} \LTwoNorm{e^h} \\
&\leq 2 c h^2 \ANorm{f}{L^2(\Omega)}
\end{align*}
where we have applied Cauchy-Schwarz in line two, and used $|R| = 1/4$, $\LTwoNorm{I_R} = 1/2$ in line 3, as well as the theorem quoted above.

Therefore, from this estimate we expect that $|J(e^h)|$ should decrease proportional to $h^2$. Inspecting the numerical results from Q2(b), we see that upon refining the grid size by factors of 2, $|J(e^h)|$ decreases by factors of approximately 3.6056 and 3.9480 with decreasing $h$, approaching the theoretical rate of $2^2=4$. Therefore, yes, the \textit{a priori} error estimate does indeed agree with the numerical results.

\end{solution}
