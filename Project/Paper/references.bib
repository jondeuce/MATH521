Measurements of CBF are therefore widely used in the localization of neuronal response to stimulation and in the evaluation of patients suspected of acute ischemic stroke or flow-limiting carotid stenosis. It was recently demonstrated that capillary transit time heterogeneity (CTH) limits maximum oxygen extraction fraction (OEFmax) that can be achieved for a given CBF. Here we present a statistical approach for determining CTH, mean transit time (MTT), and CBF using dynamic susceptibility contrast magnetic resonance imaging (DSC-MRI). Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that CTH, MTT, and OEFmax can be estimated with low bias and variance across a wide range of microvascular flow patterns, even at modest signal-to-noise ratios. Mean transit time estimated by singular value decomposition (SVD) deconvolution, however, is confounded by CTH. The proposed technique readily identifies malperfused tissue in acute stroke patients and appears to highlight information not detected by the standard SVD technique. We speculate that this technique permits the non-invasive detection of tissue with impaired oxygen delivery in neurologic disorders such as acute ischemic stroke and Alzheimer's disease during routine diagnostic imaging.},

	abstract = {The BOLD signal consists of an intravascular (IV) and an extravascular (EV) component from both small and large vessels. Their relative contributions are dependent on field strength, imaging technique, and echo time. The IV and EV contributions were investigated in the human visual cortex at 4 and 7 T using spin-echo and gradient-echo BOLD fMRI with and without suppression of blood effects. Spin-echo acquisition suppresses EV BOLD from large veins and reflects predominantly blood T2 changes and EV BOLD signal from small blood vessels. At a short echo time (32 ms), diffusion gradient-based suppression of blood signals resulted in a 75\% and 20\% decrease in spin-echo BOLD changes at 4 T and 7 T, respectively. However, at echo times (55–65 ms) approximating tissue T2 typically used for optimal BOLD contrast, these gradients had much smaller effects at both fields, consistent with the decreasing blood T2 with increasing field strength. Gradient-echo BOLD percent changes, with relatively long echo times at both fields, were virtually unaffected by gradients that attenuated the blood contribution because the EV BOLD surrounding both large and small vessels dominated. These results suggest that spin-echo BOLD fMRI at 4 and 7 T, with TE approximating tissue T2, significantly reduces nonspecific mapping signals from large vessels and significantly accentuates microvasculature contributions.

Most of the subcortical arteries ran straight through the cortex, but upon entering the white matter, they began to coil, loop, and spiral. Vascular stains showed wide spaces between the adventitial sheaths and blood vessels. The blood vessels coiled, looped, and spiraled within these wide adventitial spaces. This phenomenon was observed in the brains from persons ranging from the first to ninth decades of life and there were no statistically significant age-related correlations. Furthermore, there was no evidence of a reduction in the volume of white matter after fixation. Therefore, the observed tortuosity does not appear to be the result of shrinkage of brain tissue following fixation. While the mechanisms responsible for the subcortical arteries circuitry remain undetermined, this coiling architecture may serve as a trap for tumor cells and microorganisms passing through the blood stream, suggesting that these coiling arterial blood vessels may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of tumor metastasis and the brain abscess that frequently occurs in the gray-white matter junction.},

Perfusion parameters and the raw dynamic susceptibility contrast signals were correlated with tissue orientation. Additionally, numerical simulations were performed for a range of vascular volumes of both the isotropic vascular bed and anisotropic vessel components, as well as for a range of contrast agent concentrations. The effect of the contrast agent was much larger in white matter tissue perpendicular to the main magnetic field compared to white matter parallel to the main magnetic field. In addition, cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood volume were affected in the same way with angle-dependent variations of up to 130\%. Mean transit time and time to maximum of the residual curve exhibited weak orientation dependency of 10\%. Numerical simulations agreed with the measured data, showing that one-third of the white matter vascular volume is comprised of vessels running in parallel with the fibre tracts.},

	abstract = {Background
Dilated brain perivascular spaces (PVSs) are found to be associated with many conditions, including aging, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Conventionally, PVS assessment is mainly based on subjective observations of the number, size and shape of PVSs in MR images collected at clinical field strengths (≤3 T). This study tests the feasibility of imaging and quantifying brain PVS with an ultra-high 7 T whole-body MRI scanner.
New method
3D high resolution T2-weighted brain images from healthy subjects (n = 3) and AD patients (n = 5) were acquired on a 7 T whole-body MRI scanner. To automatically segment the small hyperintensive fluid-filling PVS structures, we also developed a quantitative program based on algorithms for spatial gradient, component connectivity, edge-detection, k-means clustering, etc., producing quantitative results of white matter PVS volume densities.
Results
The 3D maps of automatically segmented PVS show an apparent increase in PVS density in AD patients compared to age-matched healthy controls due to the PVS dilation (8.0 ± 2.1 v/v\% in AD vs. 4.9 ± 1.3 v/v\% in controls, p \&lt; 0.05).
Comparison with existing method
We demonstrated that 7 T provides sufficient SNR and resolution for quantitatively measuring PVSs in deep white matter that is challenging with clinical MRI systems (≤3 T). Compared to the conventional visual counting and rating for the PVS assessment, the quantitation method we developed is automatic and objective.
Conclusions
Quantitative PVS MRI at 7 T may serve as a non-invasive and endogenous imaging biomarker for diseases with PVS dilation.},

	abstract = {Pulsed magnetic field gradient (PFG) NMR is today a routine method for the determination of self-diffusion coefficients, D. However, a remaining goal is the improvement of the precision of the method. The best procedure for the determination of accurate diffusion coefficients by PFG NMR is a calibration with a sample of precisely known D-value. In continuation of our previous work on calibration at 25°C (M. Holz and H. Weingärtner, J. Magn. Reson., 1991, 92, 115) we present reference data as a function of temperature. Since H2O plays an outstanding role as liquid and as primary standard, we carefully measured self-diffusion coefficients of water by 1H PFG NMR in the temperature range from + 5 to + 55°C and added literature data obtained from tracer methods in the range between 0 and + 100°C. This comparatively large collection of data could then be fitted to a Speedy–Angell power law, showing the excellent congruence of the results of two completely different methods and proofing the certainty of the absolute values for water. In this manner reliable primary standard values with error limits of \&lt;1\% were obtained, allowing us to adapt the temperature of the standard water to the sample temperature of interest. We further give 1H PFG NMR self-diffusion reference data in the range from + 5 to + 55°C for six easily accessible solvents, which we propose as secondary calibration standards, namely cyclohexane, dioxane, dodecane, DMSO, tetradecane and pentanol, covering a large range of absolute D-values and allowing us to match in addition the absolute D-values of calibration sample and sample under investigation. Furthermore, the gained accurate self-diffusion data are suited for an elaborate check of theoretical approaches in the physics of molecular liquids.},

Between subjects CBF correlated positively with CMRO2, although the interindividual variability of the measured values was large. OER was not dependent on CMRO2, but highly negatively correlated with CBF. CBV correlated positively with CBF. When considering the values of all the regions of interest within a single subject, a strict coupling between CMRO2 and CBF, and between CBF and CBV was found, while OER was constant and independent of CBF and CMRO2. In 'pure' grey and white matter regions CMRO2, CBF and CBV decreased with age approximately 0.50\% per year. In other regions the decline was less evident, most likely due to partial volume effects. OER did not change or showed a slight increase with age (maximum in the grey matter region 0.35\%/yr). The results suggest diminished neuronal firing or decreased dendritic synaptic density with age.},

Relatively little is known on the topographic differences in vascular supply, distribution and density of brain capillaries in different CNS regions. We developed a simple method consisting of intravascular injection of fluorescent dyes coupled to immunocytochemical techniques that allows for simultaneous observation of glia–neuronal–vascular interactions in immersion-fixed brain specimens from small rodents. This technique permits quantitative evaluation of regional differences in glial/neuronal distribution and the study of their relationship to vascular densities. Variations of this technique also allow the detection of abnormal microvasculature (i.e. ‘leaky’ vessels), a useful feature for studies of blood–brain barrier function in health and disease. By use of quantitative confocal microscopy, the three-dimensional geometry of cortical and hippocampal structures revealed remarkable differences in vascularization between cortical gray/white matter junction, and hippocampal formation (CA1 and CA3 regions). Significant differences were also observed within the same investigative region: CA1 was characterized by low capillary density compared to neighboring CA3. Following an ischemic insult, CA1 vessels had more extensive blood–brain barrier leakage than CA3 vessels. We conclude that in addition to neuronal and glial heterogeneity, cortical structures are also endowed with region-specific vascular patterns characterized by distinct pathophysiological responses.},

	abstract = {Purpose

Results from several recent studies suggest the magnetic resonance diffusion-derived metric mean kurtosis (MK) to be a sensitive marker for tissue pathology; however, lengthy acquisition and postprocessing time hamper further exploration. The purpose of this study is to introduce and evaluate a new MK metric and a rapid protocol for its estimation.


Methods

The protocol requires acquisition of 13 standard diffusion-weighted images, followed by linear combination of log diffusion signals, thus avoiding nonlinear optimization. The method was evaluated on an ex vivo rat brain and an in vivo human brain. Parameter maps were compared with MK estimated from a standard diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) data set comprising 160 diffusion-weighted images.


Results

The new MK displays remarkably similar contrast to MK, and the proposed protocol acquires the necessary data in less than 1 min for full human brain coverage, with a postprocessing time of a few seconds. Scan–rescan reproducibility was comparable with MK.


Conclusion

The framework offers a robust and rapid method for estimating MK, with a protocol easily adapted on commercial scanners, as it requires only minimal modification of standard diffusion-weighting protocols. These properties make the method feasible in practically any clinical setting.},

	abstract = {A particularly powerful paradigm for functional MR imaging of microvascular hemodynamics incorporates paramagnetic materials that create significant image contrast. These include exogenous (lanthanide chelates) and endogenous (deoxygenated hemoglobin) agents for mapping cerebral blood volume and neuronal activity, respectively. Accurate interpretation of these maps requires an understanding of the biophysics of susceptibility-based image contrast. The authors developed a novel Monte Carlo model with which the authors quantified the relationship between microscopic tissue parameters, NMR imaging parameters, and susceptibility contrast in vivo. The authors found vascular permeability to water and the flow of erythrocytes to be relatively unimportant contributors to susceptibility-induced delta R2. However, pulse sequence, echo time, and concentration of contrast agent have profound effects on the vessel size dependence of delta R2. For a model vasculature containing both capillaries and venules, the authors predicted a linear volume fraction dependence for physiological volume changes based on recruitment and dilation, and a concentration dependence that is nonlinear and pulse sequence dependent. Using the model, the authors demonstrated that spin echo functional images have greater microvascular sensitivity than gradient echo images, and that the specifies of the volume fraction and concentration dependence of transverse relaxivity change should allow for robust mapping of relative blood volume. The authors also demonstrated excellent agreement between the predictions of their model and experimental data obtained from the serial injection of superparamagnetic contrast agent in a rat model.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose— Although gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) have differing neurochemical responses to ischemia in animal models, it is unclear whether this translates into differing thresholds for infarction. We studied this issue in ischemic stroke patients using magnetic resonance (MR) techniques.
Methods— MR studies were performed in patients with acute hemispheric ischemic stroke occurring within 24 hours and at 3 months. Cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), mean transit time (MTT), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were calculated. After segmentation based on a probabilistic map of GM and WM, tissue-specific diffusion and perfusion thresholds for infarction were established.
Results— Twenty-one patients were studied. Infarction thresholds for CBF were significantly higher in GM (median 34.6 mL/100 g per minute, interquartile range 26.0 to 38.8) than in WM (20.8 mL/100 g per minute; interquartile range 18.0 to 25.9; P{\textless}0.0001). Thresholds were also significantly higher in GM than WM for CBV (GM: 1.67 mL/100 g; interquartile range 1.39 to 2.17; WM: 1.19 mL/100 g; interquartile range 0.94 to 1.53; P{\textless}0.0001), ADC (GM: 918×10−6 mm2/s; 868 to 975×10−6; WM: 805×10−6; 747 to 870×10−6; P{\textless}0.001), and there was a trend toward a shorter MTT in GM (GM 4.94 s, 4.44 to 5.38; WM 5.15, 4.11 to 5.68; P=0.11).
Conclusions— GM has a higher infarction threshold for CBF, CBV, and ADC than WM in patients within 24 hours of ischemic stroke onset. Hence, when assessing patients for potential therapies, tissue-specific rather than whole-brain thresholds may be a more precise measure of predicting the likelihood of infarction.},

Slice thickness of twice the in-plane voxel size or more resulted in optimum vessel visibility. Phantom and in vivo data are in very good agreement with the simulations and the delineation of vessels at 7 T was superior compared to lower field strengths. The phase of the complex data reveals anatomical details that are complementary to the corresponding magnitude images. Susceptibility weighted imaging at very high field strengths is a promising technique because of its high sensitivity to tissue susceptibility, its low specific absorption rate, and the phase's negligible sensitivity to B1 inhomogeneities.

Similar results were obtained by using a model-dependent approach that assumes an exponential residue function, but not for a Gaussian-shaped residue function or for either Fourier or regularization-based model-independent approaches. Pilot studies of our CBF mapping techniques in patients with tumor, stroke, and migraine aura demonstrated that these techniques can be readily used on data routinely acquired by using current echo planar imaging technology.

To extend susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) to multiple echoes with an adapted homodyne filtering of phase images for the computation of venograms with improved signal to noise ratio (SNR) and contrast to noise ratio (CNR) and to produce high resolution maps of R2* relaxation.


Materials and Methods:

Three-dimensional multi echo gradient echo data were acquired with five equidistant echoes ranging from 13 to 41 ms. The phase images of each echo were filtered with filter parameters adjusted to the echo time, converted into a phase mask, and combined with the corresponding magnitude images to obtain susceptibility weighted images. The individual images were then averaged. Conventional single echo data were acquired for comparison. Maps of R2* relaxation rates were computed from the magnitude data. Field maps derived from the phase data were used to correct R2* for the influences from background inhomogeneities of the static magnetic field.


Results:

Compared with the single echo images, the combined images had an increase in SNR by 46\% and an improvement in CNR by 34 to 80\%, improved visibility of small venous vessels and reduced blurring along the readout direction. The R2* values of different tissue types are in good agreement with values from the literature.


Conclusion:

Acquisition of SWI with multiple echoes leads to an increase in SNR and CNR and it allows the computation of high resolution maps of R2* relaxation. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2010;31:185–191. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Cerebral blood flow and volume scale linearly with the area under the AIF, but shape changes of the AIF can lead to large, nonlinear errors. Current manual and automated AIF selection procedures do not guarantee the exclusion of partial volume effects from AIF measurements. This study uses a numerical model, validated by phantom experiments, for predicting the optimal location for AIF measurements in the vicinity of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Three different sequences were investigated and evaluated on a voxel-by-voxel basis by comparison with the ground truth. Subsequently, the predictions were evaluated in an in vivo example. The findings are fourfold: AIF measurements should be performed in voxels completely outside the artery, here a linear relation should be assumed between ΔR*2 and the concentration contrast agent, the exact optimal location differs per acquisition type, and voxels including a small MCA yield also correct AIF measurements for segmented echo planar imaging when a short echo time was used.},

This approach has been applied to evaluate the NMR signal in the presence of a blood vessel network (with an application to functional imaging), bone marrow (for two specific trabecular structures, asymmetrical and columnar) and a ferrite contrast agent. All investigated systems have some common behavior. If the echo time TE is less than a known characteristic time tc for a given system, then the signal decays exponentially with an argument which depends quadratically on TE. This is equivalent to an R2* relaxation rate which is a linear function of TE. In the opposite case, when TE is greater than tc, the NMR signal follows a simple exponential decay and the relaxation rate does not depend on the echo time. For this time interval, R2* is a linear function of a) volume fraction ζ occupied by the field-creating objects, b) magnetic field B0 or just the objects' magnetic moment for ferrite particles, and c) susceptibility difference Δχ between the objects and the medium.},

In a temperature controlled circulation system, these rates were measured for blood in vitro at 3T under conditions akin to the physiological state. Single spin echo (SE) and gradient echo (GRE) sequences were used to determine R2 and R 2*, respectively. Both rates varied quadratically with deoxygenation, and changes in R 2* were found to be due predominantly to changes in R2. These data were used to estimate intravascular blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contributions during visual activation. Due to the large R 2* in venous blood, intravascular SE BOLD signal changes were larger than GRE effects at echo times above 30 ms. When including extravascular effects to estimate the total BOLD effect, GRE BOLD dominated due to the large tissue volume fraction. Magn Reson Med 58:592–596, 2007. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

A three-dimensional finite element method was applied to a realistic model of the cortical vasculature, and the results compared with those generated from a simple model of the vasculature as a set of independent, randomly oriented, infinite cylinders. The realistic model is based on scanning electron microscopy measurements of the terminal vascular bed in the superficial cortex of the rat. Good agreement is found between the two models with regard to the extravascular R2* and R2 dependence on the cerebral blood volume and blood oxygenation fraction. Using the realistic model, it is also possible to gain further understanding of the relative importance of intravascular and extravascular BOLD contrast. A simple parameterisation of the dependence of the relaxation rates on relative cerebral blood volume and blood–tissue susceptibility difference was carried out, allowing discussion of the variation in the form of the haemodynamic response with field strength.

To compare the relative cerebral blood flow (CBF) obtained by pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling sequence incorporated with volumetric fast spin-echo readout (3D-PCASL) with those by gradient-echo (GE) and spin-echo (SE) dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI.


Materials and Methods

Thirty patients with various neurological diseases participated in this study. In addition to 3D-PCASL, 15 patients received GE-DSC and the others received SE-DSC imaging on a 3 Tesla scanner. A cortical gray matter (GM) to white matter (WM) and a thalamus (TM) to WM CBF ratio were determined from each perfusion scan. In addition, histograms of relative CBF distributions were obtained from each method for comparison.


Results

Significant correlations of CBF ratios were found between 3D-PCASL and the two DSC methods (P {\textless} 0.05). The 3D-PCASL resulted in GM/WM CBF ratios similar to SE-DSC but significantly smaller than GE-DSC (P = 2.3 × 10−7). TM/WM CBF ratio obtained by 3D-PCASL was significantly smaller than those by GE- and SE-DSC (P = 4.1 × 10−7 and 1.2 × 10−6, respectively). The histogram of relative CBF maps obtained from SE-DSC, after applied spatial smoothing, agreed well with that from 3D-PCASL.


Conclusion

This study suggested that perfusion images obtained from 3D-PCASL exhibited significant correlations with DSC-MRI, with greater microvascular weighting like SE-DSC. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2014;39:427–433. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

It briefly introduces the physical background of the underlying bulk magnetic susceptibility effects, on which this approach is based, and it demonstrates the successful application of the method for imaging different intracranial lesions, like venous anomalies, arteriovenous malformations and brain tumors. The susceptibility difference between venous blood and the surrounding tissue is used to generate contrast. Using this method it is possible to visualize draining veins in lesions better than conventional magnetic resonance imaging methods, which often require application of a contrast medium or even conventional catheter angiography. Limitations of the method are discussed. The ability to highlight deoxygenated blood with high spatial resolution yields important vascular parameters which may be helpful for improved modeling of MR signal changes during functional brain activation, it may lead to a better understanding of brain function in diseased states, or it may even offer the possibility of differentiating benign from malignant tumors non-invasively.

In addition, steady-state Laplace PDEs can be formulated to produce the homogenized diffusion tensor that describes the diffusion characteristics of the medium in the long time limit. In spatial domains that model biological tissues at the cellular level, these two types of PDEs have to be completed with permeability conditions on the cellular interfaces. To solve these PDEs, we implemented a finite elements method that allows jumps in the solution at the cell interfaces by using double nodes. Using a transformation of the Bloch–Torrey PDE we reduced oscillations in the searched-for solution and simplified the implementation of the boundary conditions. The spatial discretization was then coupled to the adaptive explicit Runge–Kutta–Chebyshev time-stepping method. Our proposed method is second order accurate in space and second order accurate in time. We implemented this method on the FEniCS C++ platform and show time and spatial convergence results. Finally, this method is applied to study some relevant questions in diffusion MRI.},

A catheter was inserted into the internal jugular veins or the carotid and vertebral arteries.

The deep med-ullary veins had four zones of covergence before draining into the subependymal veins: the first (superficial), second (candelabra), third (palmate) and fourth (subependymal). The zones of various convergence within the white matter were due to the crossing of nerve fiber tracts (e.g. the pes of the corona radiata, the radiation of the corpus callosum, the superior occipitofrontal fasciculus, the tapetum and the sagittal strata). Similar but less conspicuous information about the parenchymal arteries was observed in the arterial injection studies.

Here, we use oxygen-sensitive two-photon microscopy to measure the BOLD-relevant microvascular physiology occurring within a typical rodent fMRI voxel and predict the BOLD signal from first principles using those measurements. The predictive power of the approach is illustrated by quantifying variations in the BOLD signal induced by the morphological folding of the human cortex. This framework is then used to quantify the contribution of individual vascular compartments and other factors to the BOLD signal for different magnet strengths and pulse sequences.},

	abstract = {R2* relaxometry of the brain is a quantitative magnetic resonance technique which is influenced by iron and myelin content across different brain regions. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common inflammatory, demyelinating disease affecting both white and grey matter regions of the CNS. Using R2*, increased iron deposition has been described in deep gray matter of MS patients. Iron accumulation might promote oxidative stress in the brain, which can lead to cell death and neurodegeneration. However, recent histological work indicates that iron may be reduced within the normal appearing white matter (WM) in MS. In the present study we analyzed the R2* signal across the white matter in 39 patients with MS, 31 asymptomatic age matched siblings of patients and 30 age-matched controls. The measurement of R2* in white matter is affected by the signal's dependency on white matter fibre orientation with respect to the main magnetic field which can be accounted using diffusion tensor imaging. We observed a clear separation of the three study groups in R2*. The values in the MS group were significantly lower compared to the siblings and controls, while the siblings group presented with significantly higher R2* values than both unrelated healthy controls and patients. Furthermore, we found significantly decreased normal-appearing white matter R2* values in patients with more severe disease course. Angle resolved analysis of R2* improves the sensitivity for detecting subtle differences in WM R2* compared to standard histogram based analyses. Our findings suggest that the decreased R2* values in MS are due to diffuse tissue damage and decreased myelin in the normal appearing and diffusely abnormal WM. The increased R2* in unaffected siblings may identify a predisposition to increased iron and the potential for oxidative stress as a risk factor for developing MS.},

Despite the great potential of VSI, this method has not yet found widespread use in practice due to the lack of experience in testing it on healthy humans. Since this limitation derives mainly from the need for an invasive injection of a contrast agent, this work explores the possibility to employ instead the easily accessible blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) effect for VSI of the venous microstructure. It is demonstrated that BOLD-VSI in humans can be realized by a hypercapnic challenge using a fast gradient-echo (GE) and spin-echo (SE) sequence at 7 T. Reproducible maps of the mean venous vessel radius, based on the BOLD-induced changes in GE and SE relaxation rates, could be obtained within a scan time of 10 min. Moreover, the method yields maps of venous blood volume and vessel density. Owing to its non-invasive character, BOLD-VSI provides a low-risk method to analyze the venous microstructure, which will not only be useful in clinical applications, but also provide a better understanding of BOLD effect.},

The determination of the shape of the residue function on a regional basis is shown to be possible only at high signal-to-noise ratio. Comparison of several nonparametric deconvolution techniques showed that a nonparametric deconvolution technique (singular value decomposition) allows estimation of flow relatively independent of underlying vascular structure and volume even at low signal-to-noise ratio associated with pixel-by-pixel deconvolution.},

Cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and contrast agent mean transit time (MTT) were calculated bilaterally for 20 distinct neuroanatomic structures. Results: In gray matter, the following values were found (mean ± SD): CBV (4.6 ± 1.0 ml/100 g), CBF (94.2 ± 23.0 ml/100 g/min), and MTT (3.0 ± 0.6 s), and in white matter: CBV (1.3 ± 0.4 ml/100 g), CBF (19.6 ± 5.8 ml/100 g/min), and MTT (4.3 ± 0.7 s). The perfusion parameters did not change with age, except for a tendency to an increase in gray matter MTT and CBV. Males exhibited higher MTT and CBV than females.

	abstract = {The vascular architecture of the human cerebral deep white matter was studied using soft X-ray and diaphanized specimens, achieved by intra-arterial injection of barium and vascular stain respectively, and also by electron microscopic examination of the corrosion cast of arteries in normal adult brains. The deep white matter arteries passed through the cerebral cortex with a few branches to the cortex and ran straight through the white matter. The arteries concentrated ventriculopetally to the white matter around the lateral ventricle. Anastomoses were noted around the ventricular wall at the terminals of the deep white matter arteries. No centrifugal branches irrigating the periventricular white matter from the lenticulo-striate arteries were observed in the present study. The presence of anastomoses among the terminal branches of deep white matter arteries protects against ischemic change or infarction in this area from an occlusion of a single deep white matter artery. This may lead to development of terminal zone infarction from ischemia or vascular diseases, affecting multiple deep white matter arteries. The subcortical and deep white matter arteries had thick adventitial sheaths and large adventitial spaces in the white matter but not in the cortex. The presence or absence of the adventitial space is regarded as another characteristic difference between the arteries in the white matter and cortex. This difference may influence pathological changes in vascular lesions in these respective areas.},

It is shown that this condition implies that the wave function can be continued analytically to complex values of the "relative time" variable; similarly the wave function in momentum space can be continued analytically to complex values of the "relative energy" variable p0. In particular one is allowed to consider the wave function for purely imaginary values of t, or respectively p0, i.e., for real values of x4=ict and p4=ip0. A wave equation satisfied by this function is obtained by rotation of the integration path in the complex plane of the variable p0, and it is further shown that the formulation of the eigenvalue problem in terms of this equation presents several advantages in that many of the ordinary mathematical methods become available.},

The basic idea of the book is to provide a self-contained formulation of the theoretical framework without losing mathematical rigor, while at the same time providing physical motivation and examples. The examples are taken from applications in electron systems and transport theory. On the formal side, the book covers an introduction to second quantization, many-body Green's function, finite temperature Feynman diagrams and bosonization. The applications include traditional transport theory in bulk as well as mesoscopic systems, where both the Landau-Büttiker formalism and recent developments in correlated transport phenomena in mesoscopic systems and nano-structures are covered. Other topics include interacting electron gases, plasmons, electron-phonon interactions, superconductivity and a final chapter on one-dimensional systems where a detailed treatment of Luttinger liquid theory and bosonization techniques is given. Having grown out of a set of lecture notes, and containing many pedagogical exercises, this book is designed as a textbook for an advanced undergraduate or graduate course, and is also well suited for self-study.},

In this paper we analyze the decay pattern of the inverse of banded matrices of the form S=M⊗In+In⊗M where M is tridiagonal, symmetric and positive definite, In is the identity matrix, and ⊗ stands for the Kronecker product. It is well known that the inverses of banded matrices exhibit an exponential decay pattern away from the main diagonal. However, the entries in S−1 show a non-monotonic decay, which is not caught by classical bounds. By using an alternative expression for S−1, we derive computable upper bounds that closely capture the actual behavior of its entries. We also show that similar estimates can be obtained when M has a larger bandwidth, or when the sum of Kronecker products involves two different matrices. Numerical experiments illustrating the new bounds are also reported.},

	abstract = {A new algorithm is developed for computing \$e{\textasciicircum}\{tA\}B\$, where A is an \$n{\textbackslash}times n\$ matrix and B is \$n{\textbackslash}times n\_0\$ with \$n\_0 {\textbackslash}ll n\$. The algorithm works for any A, its computational cost is dominated by the formation of products of A with \$n{\textbackslash}times n\_0\$ matrices, and the only input parameter is a backward error tolerance. The algorithm can return a single matrix \$e{\textasciicircum}\{tA\}B\$ or a sequence \$e{\textasciicircum}\{t\_kA\}B\$ on an equally spaced grid of points \$t\_k\$. It uses the scaling part of the scaling and squaring method together with a truncated Taylor series approximation to the exponential. It determines the amount of scaling and the Taylor degree using the recent analysis of Al-Mohy and Higham [SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 31 (2009), pp. 970–989], which provides sharp truncation error bounds expressed in terms of the quantities \${\textbackslash}{\textbar}A{\textasciicircum}k{\textbackslash}{\textbar}{\textasciicircum}\{1/k\}\$ for a few values of k, where the norms are estimated using a matrix norm estimator. Shifting and balancing are used as preprocessing steps to reduce the cost of the algorithm. Numerical experiments show that the algorithm performs in a numerically stable fashion across a wide range of problems, and analysis of rounding errors and of the conditioning of the problem provides theoretical support. Experimental comparisons with MATLAB codes based on Krylov subspace, Chebyshev polynomial, and Laguerre polynomial methods show the new algorithm to be sometimes much superior in terms of computational cost and accuracy. An important application of the algorithm is to exponential integrators for ordinary differential equations. It is shown that the sums of the form \${\textbackslash}sum\_\{k=0\}{\textasciicircum}p {\textbackslash}varphi\_k(A)u\_k\$ that arise in exponential integrators, where the \${\textbackslash}varphi\_k\$ are related to the exponential function, can be expressed in terms of a single exponential of a matrix of dimension \$n+p\$ built by augmenting A with additional rows and columns, and the algorithm of this paper can therefore be employed.},

	abstract = {A geometrical confinement considerably affects the diffusive motion of the nuclei and the consequent signal attenuation under inhomogeneous magnetic fields. In this article, we illustrate the use of Laplacian eigenfunctions to describe this effect. Starting from the classical Bloch-Torrey equation, we obtain the free induction decay (FID) and the spin-echo or gradient-echo signal in a compact matrix form. Each attenuation mechanism (restricted diffusion, gradient dephasing, surface or bulk relaxation) is represented by a matrix which is constructed from the Laplace operator eigenbasis and thus depending only on the geometry of the confinement. In turn, the physical parameters (free diffusion coefficient, gradient intensity, surface or bulk relaxivity) characterize the “strengths” of the underlying attenuation mechanisms and naturally appear as coefficients in front of these matrices. Once the Laplacian eigenfunctions for a given confinement are found (analytically or numerically), further computation of the macroscopic signal is more accurate and much faster than by using conventional simulation methods. The matrix technique is actually a simple numerical tool to deal with arbitrary gradient waveforms, including simple or stimulated, single or multiple spin echoes. We illustrate its efficiency by considering restricted diffusion in simple domains: a slab, a cylinder, and a sphere. In a companion paper, we shall focus on theoretical advances achieved by using Laplacian eigenfunctions. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Concepts Magn Reson Part A 32A: 277–301, 2008.},

All cases were free of metabolic, neurologic and psychiatric diseases. It is demonstrated that the capillary diameter remains unchanged during aging in both brain cortex and putamen. However, in the putamen the total capillary length per unit volume and the capillary volume fraction increase (∼60\%) progressively with age. Consequently the mean inter-capillary distances in the putamen decrease (∼15\%). These age-induced changes in the putamen indicate shrinking of subcortical brain structures. In contrast to those of the putamen, the morphometric data of the capillaries in the cortex remain unchanged during the aging process. Stereologic investigations of nerve cells in the brain cortex and putamen revealed that only in brains over 85 years of age can a significant decrease in nerve cell size be demonstrated. A correlation of all the data by a correspondence analytical procedure showed that only the surface/volume ratio of the capillaries correlates with the nerve cell size. This observation suggests a functional interaction between the nerve cells and the capillaries. From the data presented it becomes apparent that the shrinkage of the gyri in the aging brain is not a change in the volume of the cortex, but is a decrease in the volume of subcortical structures.},

	abstract = {MRI phase images of the brain exhibit excellent contrast and high signal-to-noise ratio. It has been shown recently that the phase contrast not only depends on a tissue's magnetic susceptibility but also on its architecture, which offers new ways of studying biological tissues in vivo. We combined diffusion tensor imaging and multi-echo susceptibility-weighted imaging to investigate the relationship between white matter fibre orientation and gradient-echo phase and magnitude. The local angle between white matter fibres and the main magnetic field was computed from the principal diffusion direction. The phase and signal decay of the gradient-echo images revealed a characteristic relationship with fibre orientation. The phase is in agreement with a recently reported model of cerebral white matter phase contrast in MRI. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Recent MRI studies at high field have observed that, in certain white matter fiber bundles, the signal in T(2)*-weighted MRI (i.e. MRI sensitized to apparent transverse relaxivity) is dependent on fiber orientation θ relative to B(0). In this study, the characteristics of this dependency are quantitatively investigated at 7 T using ex-vivo brain specimens, which allowed a large range of rotation angles to be measured. The data confirm the previously suggested variation of R(2)* (=1/T(2)*) with θ and also indicate that this dependency takes the shape of a combination of sin2θ and sin4θ functions, with modulation amplitudes (=ΔR(2)*) reaching 6.44±0.15 Hz (or ΔT(2)*=2.91±0.33 ms) in the major fiber bundles of the corpus callosum. This particular dependency can be explained by a model of local, sub-voxel scale magnetic field changes resulting from magnetic susceptibility sources that are anisotropic. As an illustration of a potential use of the orientation dependence of R(2)*, the feasibility of generating fiber orientation maps from R(2)* data is investigated.},

Understanding the origin of this link is of great interest because it could offer access to a new diagnostic tool for investigating tissue microstructure. Since it has been suggested that myelin is the dominant source of this contrast, creating an accurate model for characterizing the effect of the myelin sheath on the evolution of the NMR signal is an essential step toward fully understanding WM contrast. In this study, we show by comparison of the results of simulations and experiments carried out on human subjects at 7T, that the magnitude and phase of signals acquired from WM in vivo can be accurately characterized by (i) modeling the myelin sheath as a hollow cylinder composed of material having an anisotropic magnetic susceptibility that is described by a tensor with a radially oriented principal axis, and (ii) adopting a two-pool model in which the water in the sheath has a reduced T2 relaxation time and spin density relative to its surroundings, and also undergoes exchange. The accuracy and intrinsic simplicity of the hollow cylinder model provides a versatile framework for future exploitation of the effect of WM microstructure on gradient echo contrast in clinical MRI.},

However, intracortical veins perpendicular to the cortical surface are suspected to degrade the laminar specificity as they drain blood from the microvasculature and BOLD signal is carried over from lower to upper cortical layers on its way to the pial surface. In this work, a vascular model of the cortex is developed to investigate the laminar specificity of the BOLD signal for Spin Echo (SE) and Gradient Echo (GE) following the integrative model presented by Uludağ et al. (2009). The results of the simulation show that the laminar point spread function (PSF) of the BOLD signal presents similar features across all layers. The PSF for SE is highly localised whereas for GE there is a flat tail running to the pial surface, with amplitude less than a quarter of the response from the layer itself. Consequently the GE response at any layer will also contain a contribution accumulated from all lower layers.},

A standard least squares fit is proposed for the extraction of susceptibility for a single object from MR images. Simulations and a phantom study confirm both the discrete method and the feasibility of the least squares fit approach. Finding accurate susceptibility values of local structures in the brain from MR images may be possible with this approach in the future.},

	abstract = {Operator splitting is a numerical method of computing the solution to a differential equation. The splitting method separates the original equation into two parts over a time step, separately computes the solution to each part, and then combines the two separate solutions to form a solution to the original equation. A canonical example is splitting of diffusion terms and convection terms in a convection-diffusion partial differential equation. Related applications of splitting for reaction-diffusion partial differential equations in chemistry and in biology are emphasized here. The splitting idea generalizes in a natural way to equations with more than two operators. In all cases, the computational advantage is that it is faster to compute the solution of the split terms separately, than to compute the solution directly when they are treated together. However, this comes at the cost of an error introduced by the splitting, so strategies have been devised to control this error. This chapter introduces splitting methods and surveys recent developments in the area. An interesting perspective on absorbing boundary conditions in wave equations comes via Toeplitz-plus-Hankel splitting. One recent development, balanced splitting, deserves and receives special mention: it is a new splitting method that correctly captures steady state behavior.},
