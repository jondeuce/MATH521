function A = randSPDmat(n)
% Generate a dense n x n symmetric, positive definite matrix

A = rand(n,n); % generate a random n x n matrix

% construct a symmetric matrix using either
A = 0.5*(A+A');

% since A(i,j) < 1 by construction and a symmetric diagonally dominant
% matrix is symmetric positive definite, which can be ensured by adding nI
A = A + n*eye(n);
